# Real Estate Management System

This is a full-stack real estate management system developed for Database Management Systems.  
It uses a Spring Boot RESTful API with a MySQL database for the backend and a React application for the frontend.
This system allows a real estate company to manage and track properties, agents, clients, listings, branches and appointments efficiently through a secure, well-structured API

- **Agents:** Real estate agents working for specific branches, with personal and professional information.
- **Clients:** Clients interested in buying or selling properties, with contact details.
- **Properties:** Properties available for sale or rent, including details like address, price, description, and status.
